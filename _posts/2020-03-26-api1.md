# Introduction

## API

**API** stands for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface. It defines how tow pieces of software talk to each other. 

API requests sometimes have structured data. API responses almost always have structured data.

In this article, I am focusing on Web APIs. 

## Data Types & Structured Data

JSON has 3 types:
- Number
- String
- Boolean

XML has 1 type:
- String

2 common types of collections:
- Array: a size and an order
- Dictionary: key-value pairs

# JSON

## Objects

Objects are JSON's dictionaries, which are enclosed in curly brackets {}. Keys and values are separated by a colon. Pairs are separated by commas. Keys and values can be any data type.

```
{"red": 205, "green": 123, "blue": 53}
```
