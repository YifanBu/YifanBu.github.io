# Introduction

Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.

# Features of Sass

- **Variables**: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc;
- **Nesting**: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code;
- **Operators**: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS;
- **Partials and imports**: to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one single file;
- **Mixins**: to write reusable pieces of CSS code;
- **Functions**: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used;
- **Entends**: selectors inherit declarations;
- **Control directives**: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops.
