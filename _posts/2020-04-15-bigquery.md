# Introduction

## Why BigQuery?

On-premise data analysis face query, infrastructure, and storage challenges. 

Why GCP is used for data analysis:

- Storage is cheap
- Focus on queries and insights, not infrastructure
- Massive scalability

BigQuery scales automatically and you only pay for what you use.

You are billed for the resources you use:

- Bucket Storage
- Query processing and Table Storage


5 steps of analyzing and gleaning insights from data:

1. Ingest: Get data in.
2. Transform: Prepare, clean, and transform data.
3. Store: Create, save, and store datasets.
4. Analyze: Derive insights from data.
5. Visualize: Explore and present data insights.

## BigQuery Fundamentals

BigQuery is a petabyte-scale data analytics warehouse.

Two services in one: 

1. Analysis
2. Managed Storage

## Other tools


# Data


## Exploring Data with SQL


## Cleaning and Transforming Data

High quality datasets conform to strict integrity rules:

1. Validity
2. Accuracy
3. Completeness
4. Consistency
5. Uniformity

Understanding Dataset Shape:

- Numbers of Columns
- Numbers of Rows

Understanding Dataset Skew (Distribution of Values)
