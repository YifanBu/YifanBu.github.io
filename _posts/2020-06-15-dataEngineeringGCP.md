key job skills: designing, building, and running data processing systems; and operationalizing machine-learning models.

# Big Data & ML Fundamentals

## Big Data Challenges

1. Migrating existing data workloads
2. Analyzing large datasets at scale
3. Building streaming data pipelines(so that the business can make data-driven decisions more quickly)
4. Applying machine learning to your data(not just reacting to data, but also predicting)

## Examples

1. Compute Power: Creating a VM on Compute engine
2. Storage: Elastic Storage with Google Cloud Storage
3. Networking: Google's data center network speed enables the separation of compute and storage
4. Security: Cloud IAM
5. Big data and ML

## Choosing the right approach

### Compute: 
* Compute Engine:individual machines running native code, Infrastructure as a service(Iaas)
* Google Kubernetes Engine: clusters of machines running containers
* App Engine: Platform as a Service (Paas)
* Cloud Function: a completely serverless execution environment, Function as a service(Faas)

### Storage:
* Cloud Bigtable
* Cloud Storage
* Cloud SQL
* Cloud Spanner
* Cloud Datastore






# Modernizing Data Lakes and Data Warehouses

# Building Batch Data Pipelines

Extra-Load,Extract-Load-Transform or Extract-Transform-Load paradigms.

# Building Resilient Streaming Analytics Systems

Processing streaming data is becoming increasingly popular as streaming enables businesses to get real-time metrics on business operations.

# Smart Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI

Incorporating machine learning into data pipelines increases the ability of businesses to extract insights from their data.
