# Overview

## Why
As the **industry standard** for web analytics, probably the most important tool for marketer, business owner or entrepreneur.

Successful businesses are not built on guesswork. They thrive on the ability to make **data-driven decisions**.

Google analytics gives you the metrics to see what is working and what is not working.

"If you cant measure it, you cant improve it."

## How it works

- To collect data, a small piece of **tracking code** is added to each page on a website. This tracking code will collect **anonymous** information about a visitor interacts with the site. e.g. the URLs
of the pages visited.
- With this information, Google Analytics can calculate which pages are most popular or determine if users reached the purchase confirmation page.
- Google Analytics will also collect information like the **language** the browser is set to, the type of browser (such as Chrome or Safari), the device and operating system used and the users location, age and gender. It can even collect the “traffic source,” which brought users to the site in the first place. This might be a search engine, an advertisement they clicked on, or an email marketing campaign.
- Google Analytics uses a browser cookie (a small bit of text stored in the browser) to generate a random ID to distinguish between new and returning visitors and tie all the activity of a visitor into a single visit.
- Each period of activity is called a “session.” Google Analytics ends a session by default after 30 minutes of inactivity or when a user closes a browser window.
- Finally, all of this information is sent to Google Analytics to populate your reports.


# Basics

## Views

1. Raw Data View

When a new view is created, only website data from date the view was created will be included, so best to set up right away.

## Filters

Filters let you include, exclude, or modify the data you collect in a view.
